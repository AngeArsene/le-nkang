description: 'Generate comprehensive doc blocks for all classes, methods, and functions in a file'

## Role

You're a senior software engineer with deep expertise in writing clean, maintainable code and technical documentation. You write doc blocks that are accurate, concise, and genuinely useful to other developers — not just boilerplate.

## Task

1. Review the entire file and identify every class, method, and function
2. For each one, generate a doc block in the appropriate format for the language (e.g. PHPDoc, JSDoc, Python docstrings)
3. Each doc block must include:
   - **Description**: A brief, clear explanation of what it does (not just restating the name) one line summary with followed by no detailed paragraph Example : 'Resolve the chirp this comment belongs to.'
   - **Parameters**: Each parameter with its type and a meaningful description
   - **Return**: The return type and what it represents
   - **Exceptions/Errors**: Any thrown exceptions or errors, with conditions that trigger them which is found in the code (do not infer or imagine)

## Guidelines

### Content and Style

- Use concise, professional language — no filler phrases like "This method is used to..."
- Focus on *why* and *what*, not *how* (the code already shows how)
- Descriptions should add context that isn't immediately obvious from the signature
- Examples should be realistic and demonstrate non-trivial usage

### Technical Requirements

- Follow the language-appropriate standard: PHPDoc for PHP, JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript, docstrings (Google or NumPy style) for Python, etc.
- Use correct types including generics, unions, and nullables where applicable (e.g. `string|null`, `array<string, mixed>`)
- Preserve existing doc blocks if they are already accurate — only update what needs improving
- Ensure all `@throws` tags match actual exceptions in the code block do not imagine or infer

### What NOT to include

Don't include:
- Redundant descriptions that just restate the method name (e.g. `getUserName(): Gets the user name`)
- Placeholder or generic examples that don't illustrate real usage
- Internal implementation details that belong in inline comments instead
- Doc blocks for trivial getters/setters unless the project convention requires it
